# The library is a committed file, not a fetch-at-test-time dependency, for two reasons:
# `task test:scripts:bats` has to work with no network, and CI must load the same bytes the
# developer loaded. A helper resolved from one place locally and another in CI reintroduces the
# local-green/CI-red class the library exists to prevent.
#
# This script only refreshes that file (`sync`) or proves it has not drifted (`--check`). It is
# never invoked by the test path. ~keep
