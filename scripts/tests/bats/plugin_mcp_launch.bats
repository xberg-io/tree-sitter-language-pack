#
# FAN-OUT SHARED: byte-identical in xberg, crawlberg, html-to-markdown, liter-llm and
# tree-sitter-language-pack. Unlike the scripts/lib suites, the five launchers are NOT one script
# plus a token -- they have diverged into different internal function names (`runnable` vs
# `runs_ok`, `try_download` vs `download_install`), different log wording and different download
# integrity postures. What has NOT diverged is what the script does when you run it.
#
# So this suite tests strictly through the process boundary: it runs the script and asserts the
# exit status, which launcher was exec'd, and that argv arrives intact. Internal names never
# appear, which is what lets one file cover five divergent implementations. Every parameter it
# needs is read out of the script in setup_file, so it names no product.
#
# The script exec()s, so the launcher it chooses BECOMES the process -- a stub that prints a
# marker is therefore direct evidence of the branch taken, not an inference from log text. ~keep

# which architectures are published, and -- the one that matters -- what integrity means.
#
# Three postures exist today across five products shipping the same launcher:
#   * no checksum at all; warns that HTTPS is the only protection, then installs
#   * fetches a SHA256SUMS asset and REFUSES to execute a binary with no entry
#   * fetches it, and on a missing entry warns and installs anyway

# first -- it would have gone on passing had those launchers installed unverified binaries
